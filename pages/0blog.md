### How my BLOG was created

(20.03) For my blog, I have chosen **GitHub Pages** with **disqus** comments, as I was interested to learn how to use it for some time. When Pages with comment functionality were created, the next question was to how to structure and organise my future blogs. The principles that I followed:

#### 1. Structure
Almost every week, I create a blog with a new topic according to the topic we have for our class. Then, when later I need information about any particular theme, I will go to the corresponding blog.

Apart from thematical (or content) blogs, the current blog0 was created, to provide general description about the whole BLOG: its structure, content and the creation process.

By 26.04 there are 7 **content** blog pages and 1 **organisation** blog:
. How my BLOG was created
1. Data preparation
2. Linear models
3. R basics
4. R playing around with a language corpus
5. Dates and times
6. Data transformation
7. TBA

By 22.05 the structure has been changed and in the final version there are 9 **content** blog pages and 1 **organisation** blog:
. How my BLOG was created
1. Data preparation
2. Linear models
3. R basics
4. R playing around with a language corpus
5. Dates and times
6. Data transformation and wrangling 1
7. Interaction effects and Model fitting
8. Data transformation and wrangling 2
9. Aggregation and summarizing

#### 2. Content
(20.03) From the beginning I decided to put my code library inside the blog. The reasons to do this:
- **easy to access**: it is always easy and fast to open it, simply going to my GitHub profile.
- **convenient navigation**: each topic is in a separate blog but all of them can be reached from the main page.
- **easy to share**: other students can see and use my library.

For me the *purpose* to create the library is to put all important information that I have learnt from the course together. This information can be: from reading assignments, knowledge from the lectures and useful links. At the beginning of each blog there is a short description about how the library part for this particular topic was created.

(09.04) The content for the blogs is mostly taken from reading assignments ("R for Data Science"). This is usually basic knolegde about R, since I did not work with it before.
Blog 4 ("R playing around with a language corpus") is my trying on working with a small linguistic data set.

(10.05) Most of the blog posts have been modified since the moment they were created. Learning new materials I see sometimes that posts are better to be reorganised and the content is redistributed in a new way. For example, as data wrangling is a large topic, I decided to split it into two separated posts: one of which is mostly about the operation within a table and another one is more (not only) about operation between tables.

(22.05) My commits activity: <https://github.com/yunigma/yunigma.github.io/graphs/commit-activity>

(24.05) I have recently started with the code assignment and I am happy to notice that now I am using my library quite regularly.
