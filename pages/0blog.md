### How my BLOG was created

For my blog, I have chosen **GitHub Pages** with **disqus** comments, as I was interested to learn how to use it for some time. When Pages with comment functionality were created, the next question was to how to structure and organise my future blogs. The principles that I followed:

#### 1. Structure
Almost every week, I create a blog with a new topic according to the topic we have for our class. Then, when later I need information about any particular theme, I will go to the corresponding blog.

Apart from thematical (or content) blogs, the current blog0 was created, to provide general description about the whole BLOG: its structure, content and the creation process.

By 26.04 there are 7 **content** blog pages and 1 **organisation** blog:
0. How my BLOG was created
1. Data preparation
2. Linear models
3. R basics
4. R playing around with a language corpus
5. Dates and times
6. Data transformation
7. TBA

#### 2. Content
From the beginning I decided to put my code library inside the blog. The reasons to do this:
- **easy to access**: it is always easy and fast to open it, simply going to my GitHub profile.
- **convenient navigation**: each topic is in a separate blog but all of them can be reached from the main page.
- **easy to share**: other students can see and use my library.

For me the *purpose* to create the library is to put all important information that I have learnt from the course together. This information can be: from reading assignments, knowledge from the lectures and useful links. At the beginning of each blog there is a short description about how the library part for this particular topic was created.

The content for the blogs is mostly taken from reading assignments ("R for Data Science"). This is usually basic knolegde about R, since I did not work with it before.
Blog 4 ("R playing around with a language corpus") is my trying on working with a small linguistic data set.
